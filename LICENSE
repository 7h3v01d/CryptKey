## Overview

**Enhanced Python Import Cycle Scanner & Visualizer** is a modern desktop and CLI tool designed to analyze Python project structures, detect circular imports, and visualize module dependencies through an interactive graph interface.

This repository is published **solely for evaluation and showcase purposes**, demonstrating implementation quality, architectural decisions, and tooling approach.

---

## Features

- Scans entire Python projects for **module-to-module import relationships**
- Detects **circular dependencies** using graph analysis (strongly connected components)
- Interactive **dependency graph visualization** (pyvis + vis.js)
  - Red nodes indicate modules involved in cycles
  - Zoom, pan, drag, and hover for inspection
- Structured **tree/table view** of modules and imports
- Visual highlighting of cyclic modules
- One-click **rescan** (Ctrl+R)
- **JSON export** of dependency data
- Operates as both:
  - Desktop GUI application
  - Lightweight CLI analysis tool
- Fully local execution (no internet access required)
